**Description of Authorized work(s), undertaking(s) or activity(ies):**
The work(s), undertaken(s), or activities(ies) authorized with the proposed project described above, that are likely to result in serious harm to fish:

- Installation and maintenance of an installed stream berm covering 1,469 m² – 2,358 m² for 13 months.

**Serious Harm to Fish:**
The serious harm to fish likely to result from the proposed work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies), covered by this authorization includes:
