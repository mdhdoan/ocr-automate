Here's the extracted text from the document, aiming for the closest possible representation:

“The Lake has been high since the commencement of the spawning season and there’s salmon grounds have been heavily spawned out. A large percentage of the eggs were spawned well below the low water level and these will undoubtedly perish when the water recedes.

This is the first year that all our eggs have been collected within a half mile radius of the hatchery. There was a heavy salmon spawning in the lake and the Upper Clayoquot River had more salmon spawning than any previous year. I estimate that there were three and four millions of naturally spawned salmon eggs in the Upper Clayoquot River and upwards of ten millions spawned naturally in the Clayoquot River. My estimate of the total number of salmon eggs was approximately 30,000.

Owing to the rivers being in almost continuous freshet, since we closed fishing, I have not an opportunity of inspecting the Elk River so this year and have not an opportunity of inspecting the Taylor Creek.

A good supply of salmon was found in the mouth of the creek, but very few salmon were spent fish. About 10000 salmon were found in the mouth of the creek.

The lake fell pretty little and these made many of the fresh eggs were washed out into the lake where several salmon were feeding.

There were not many spring salmon spawning at the mouth of the Taylor Creek, but less than 10000 were found at the mouth of the creek. I estimate there would be about two hundred springs and between four and five thousand chums. There are still a few pairs of salmon spawning out there.

I figure the cost of collecting this years eggs was $72.95 to $3.26 cents per thousand.”
