c) The Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam shall be opened no later than April 1 and remain open until July 15 with sufficient flows to provide spawning opportunities for Walleye, Suckers and Lake Sturgeon in the spawning grounds downstream of the dam.

d) If the proponent cannot close the dam on or before October 10, or sufficiently reopen the dam by April 1, or requires any modification of these restricted activity timing window, Fishes and Fisheries Ontario (DFO) must be notified. DFO may, where it considers appropriate, provide in writing notice that the period to carry on the work, undertaking or activity has been extended. Additional monitoring of impacts from this timing change shall be provided by the proponent as requested by DFO and reported as outlined in condition 3 of this Authorization. This additional offsetting shall be provided by the proponent depending upon monitoring results and as requested by DFO and reported as outlined in condition 5 of this Authorization.

   **Subtitle:** 
   4.1 Letter of credit: Not Applicable (N/A)

   **Subtitle:** 
   4.2 Scale and description of offsetting measures: In accordance with the Proponent’s offsetting plan found in the Application for Authorization (February 27, 2015) the following measures shall be undertaken:

   **Subsection Title:**  
   a). Construction of 3200 m² of boulder/cohbre habitat and installation of a minimum of 75 large boulders (diameter piers .5m in all directions) on 5 m spacing downstream of instream piers to provide enhanced spawning habitat and cover for Lake Sturgeon and other fish species.

   **Subsection Title:**  
   b). Operating the Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam to enhance spawning opportunities for Lake Sturgeon, Lake Whitefish and other fish species.
   
      a) An Operating Plan for the Timekaming Ontario Dam shall be developed by the proponent in discussion with DFO to guide the opening and closing of select piers to provide water volumes and velocities that are to the benefit of spawning fish to the extent that natural inflows, water management requirements and safe operations of the dam allow. The plan may provide a range of operating options from October 1 to July 15 of any given year to provide as much optimal spawning and egg development habitat as possible for fish species as outlined below. This plan shall be provided to DFO by January 30, 2016. The Operating Plan must include review and approval by January 31, 2016. The Operating Plan is modified as agreed in writing by DFO for the life of the structure if monitoring finds that certain open/closed bay patterns or flow velocities are more attractive and suitable for successful spawning and egg development, or at the request of DFO and in discussion with the proponent.

      b) Lake Whitefish: Operate the dam to create even flows across the river channel and quiet areas next to moderate current to optimize suitable habitat for Lake Whitefish to spawn near the dam. This shall be achieved by alternating open and closed days across the structure, and maintaining water velocities of 0.5-1 m/s in the open bays immediately adjacent to closed bays. This operation shall continue to the extent that natural inflows and operational requirements allow from October 1 until water levels upstream and downstream of the dam are approximately even in mid-February each year and all stop logs are removed.

**Footer:**
8**Paragraph 35(2)(b) Fisheries Act Authorization:**
- **Lake Sturgeon:** Operate the device to create even flows across the river channel and quiet areas next to fast current to optimize suitable habitat for Lake Sturgeon to spawn near the dam. This shall be achieved by alternating open and closed bays across the structure, and maintaining water velocities of 1 to 2 m/s in the open bays immediately adjacent to closed bays. This operation shall continue to the extent that natural inflows and operational requirements allow when stop logs are replaced in the dam in early-April until July 15 each year.

**Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam:** During normal operations, the Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam shall be operated as detailed on the operating plan from October 1 to July 15 of any given year. Natural inflows permitting and for the life of the structure. During normal operations, flows in the Ottawa River shall continue to be split between the Timiskaming Ontario and Quebec Dams.

**Normal Operations:** The Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam is considered to be under normal operations when the Ontario and Quebec dams of the Timiskaming Darbon Complex are both fully operational and are not undergoing required maintenance or construction between October 1 and July 15 that might require alteration to normal operations.**Title:**

4.4 Contingency measures related to offsetting:

**Body Text:**

4.4.1 If the results of monitoring as required in condition 5 indicate that the offsetting measures are not completed by the date specified and/or are not functioning according to the above criteria in 4.3, the Proponent shall give written notice to DFO and shall implement the contingency measures and associated monitoring measures, as contained within the approved offsetting plan in Section 8.6 of the Application for Authorization (February 27, 2015), to ensure that the implementation of the offsetting measures is completed and/or functioning as required by this authorization.

4.4.2 Additional Offsetting requirements: Should works occur within the spawning timing window (condition 2.2.1(d)) or should Emergency Flooding Contingency measures (condition 2.3.2) be employed and should monitoring indicate that impacts are greater than the planned offsetting measures, additional offsetting shall be constructed as directed by DFO and in discussion with the proponent.

4.4.3 Monitoring additional offsetting requirements shall be conducted as directed by DFO and in discussion with the proponent.

4.5 The Proponent shall not carry on any work, undertaking or activity that will adversely disturb or impact the offsetting measures.

**Subtitle:**
5.1.1 List of timeline(s) and monitoring and reporting criteria:

a) Annual monitoring for Walleye, suckers, Lake Sturgeon and Lake Whitefish spawning; Monitoring as outlined in the Application for Authorization (February 27, 2015) shall occur in years 1 and 2 after construction is complete. Spawning activity on the enhanced habitats below the Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam is to be documented using one or more techniques including capture of eggs, and/or fry, and/or visual observation with underwater video and/or DIDSON sonar documentation of active spawning behavior. If after two years of monitoring spawning is not clearly documented for any of these fish species then annual monitoring of spawning activity shall continue for those undocumented fish species until spawning is successfully continued.

**Footer:**
10**Paragraph 35(2)(b) Fisheries Act Authorization:**
14-HCAA-00814 documented to the satisfaction of DFO and for up to three additional years. During the planned construction and replacement of the Timiskaming Quebec dam, monitoring of spawning activity shall be suspended for the Timiskaming Ontario dam until normal operations resume.

**b) Assessment of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon and Lake Whitefish recruitment downstream of the Timiskaming Dam complex:**
To assess the effectiveness of dam operations and habitat enhancements an assessment of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon recruitment should be undertaken in year 3 post construction of the Timiskaming Ontario dam in the Ottawa River between the south tip of Sault Island and a point 9 km downstream as measured following the Quebec/Ontario border. The assessment will include methods outlined in the 2014 paper by McDougall et al' or similar methods as agreed to by DFO and approved by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Lake Whitefish recruitment shall be assessed if more than ten Lake Whitefish are captured incidentally during this study. The assessment shall occur within Quebec and Ontario waters on the Ottawa River starting in September or October when water temperatures are 10-15°C and include shallow water (<10 m depth) and deep water (>10 m depth) sample sites in proportion to their presence in the river. A minimum of 4 sample sites per river kilometer (minimum 36 total sample sites) shall be selected. All Lake Sturgeon and Whitefish captured during this study shall be aged using appropriate non-lethal techniques, or any incidental mortalities as a result of the study shall be aged using otoliths as well. A habitat survey of the 9 km depth and both substrate types (e.g., muck, wood chips/bark, sand/gravel, cobble/bedrock, logs).
