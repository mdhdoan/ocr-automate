**Location of Proposed Project:**
Nearest community: Calgary
Province: Alberta
City: Calgary
Name of watercourse: Bow River
Longitude and latitude: Longitude: -114.009975, Latitude: 50.894225

**Description of Proposed Project:**
The proposed project of which the work, undertaking or activity authorized is a part involves:
- Replacement of two existing bridges with two wider three-span bridges across the Bow River to accommodate future traffic on the South Calgary Ring Road. Bridge replacement will require the installation of two temporary instream berms to install the new piers and will additionally function as a working platform.
- Installation of a 3,042 m² berm on the east bank with a 1,467 m² central berm extending towards the central pier in the existing eastbound bridge in July 2019 to facilitate removal of the central pier (36 m²), extension of another pier (19 m²), and installation of a new pier (60 m²). Removal of the central berm will occur in October 2019, and the remainder of the east berm will be removed in April 2021.
- Installation of a 6,312 m² berm on the west bank in October 2019 to facilitate removal of one pier (18 m²), extension of another pier (19 m²), and installation of a new pier (60 m²). Removal of the west berm will occur in April 2021.
- A new pedestrian bridge will be constructed over the Bow River approximately 230 m downstream of the bridge replacement, which will require the installation of two temporary instream berms to install the piers and function as a working platform. The works will be constructed in one stage as follows:
  - Installation of a 563 m² berm on the east bank in April 2019 to facilitate the installation of a new pier (4 m²), with removal between July and September in 2020.
  - Installation of a 1,073 m² berm on the west bank in April 2019 to facilitate the installation of a new pier (4 m²), with removal between July and September in 2020.

**Description of Authorized work(s), undertaking(s) or activity(ies) likely to result in serious harm to fish:**
The work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies) associated with the proposed project described above, that are likely to result in serious harm to fish, are:
- Installation and maintenance of two instream berms for the Stoney Trail Bridges covering up to 10,821 m² for three years.

**PATH No.:** 18-HCAA-00253PATH No.: 18-HCAA-00253

- Installation /extension of four instream piers for the Stoney Trail Bridges covering 158 m².
- Installation and maintenance of two instream berms for the pedestrian bridge covering 1,636 m² for 14 months.
- Installation of two instream piers for the pedestrian bridge covering 8 m².

The serious harm to fish likely to result from the proposed work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies), and covered by this authorization includes:
- Permanent alteration of up to 12,457 m² for a time period that spans the normal life history processes for resident fish species.
- Permanent alteration of up to 7,262 m² of habitat due to hydraulic impacts in the channel adjacent to and between the berms that will result in reduced functionality for the carrying on of normal life history processes for resident fish species.

PATH No.: 18-HCAA-00253

2.1.4.2 Not be obtained from areas below the high water mark of any fish-frequented waters.

2.1.5 Should the need for dewatering arise, water shall be released into a well-vegetated area or settling basin and not directly into fish-frequented waters.

2.1.6 All spoil materials and debris shall be disposed of above the high water mark (HWM) such that it does not enter the watercourse. Any materials stored above the HWM shall be stabilized and properly disposed of.

2.1.7 Work that could result in sedimentation shall stop during heavy or persistent rainfall.

2.2 List of measures and standards to avoid and mitigate serious harm to fish:

2.2.1 Berm size, location, and timing of construction and removal shall adhere to plans outlined in the Application for Authorization and supporting documents. Any updates to these plans shall be reviewed and approved by DFO.

2.2.2 In-water activity shall be timed to respect the restricted timing windows of May 1st to July 15th and September 16th to April 5th of any year to protect spawning fish, their incubating eggs, and the larval stages of fish.

2.2.2.1 In year one of construction works (2019), in-water activity shall extend into the fall restricted activity period by one month, with the construction of the in-stream berms for the Stoney Trail bridges to be completed by October 15th, 2019. Should further extension into the fall restricted activity be required, the Proponent shall consult and get written approval from Alberta Environment and Parks and DFO.

2.2.3 Any natural structure that contributes to fish habitat before construction, including but not limited to: woody debris, root wads, and large boulders, shall be stockpiled and replaced as close to their original positions as possible after construction.

2.2.4 For each phase of the berms, the footprint of the berm shall not exceed an area greater than 5% of the design area without prior notification to and approval by DFO.

2.2.5 Stockpiles of berm material shall be placed on a clean surface, free of soils and debris to avoid contaminating clean material. Berm material shall be washed onsite if necessary to ensure that it is free of fine material before placement instream.
