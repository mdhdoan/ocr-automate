Dear Sir;
I beg to report upon the past sockeye spawning season at this Hatchery. The run of parent sockeye was the best since the inception of the Hatchery in 1910. The Indians spoke of it as being like the runs of years ago.
We commenced fishing on October 27th but found very few mature fish so did not attempt fishing again until October 29th. In twelve days we collected 10,272,000 eggs as follows:- Ordinary spawned eggs: 7,332,000 from split females after they had been hand stripped; 1,186,000 and 1,699,000 by the incision method. Judging by the present appearance of the eggs they are better than last year, and the incision method seems very good and I think it will prove to be the better way. The losses will not go so heavily this year and report accordingly. We averaged the eggs at 9,000 per quart.
A total of 25,600 sockeye were caught according to the daily records. You will understand that many of these fish had been previously caught and returned to the Lake because they were immature and may have been handled several times before they were in for stripping. Also a small percentage of the fish were poor, the major portion.
A total of 2,905 females and 3,918 males were stripped. The male fish predominated throughout fishing, the ratio being about two to one.
There were eighteen marked fish caught and these were all females. The system here is to try to strip and handle only the marked females, returning the salmon to the spawners strip the males, but after handling the two men commenced taking out four marked fish four marked fish which they saw later frequently returned for more notice of the markings while splitting them for drying, but they never kept their markings, until I forwarded cache to the marked fish. I am sending under separate cover the markings under separate cover.

The Lake has been high since the commencement of the spawning season and while the spawning grounds have been heavily seeded naturally, a large percentage of the eggs were spawned well above the low water level and these will undoubtedly perish when the water recedes.
This is the first year that all our eggs have been collected within a half mile radius of the Hatchery. There was a heavy seeding at the head of the Lake and the Upper Clayoquot River had more sockeye than any previous year. I estimate that there would be between three and four millions of naturally spawned sockeye eggs in the Upper Clayoquot and upwards of ten millions spawned naturally in the Clayoquot Arm. My estimate of the total number of parent sockeye is approximately 30,000.
Owing to the Rivers being in almost continuous freshet since we ceased fishing I have not had an opportunity of inspecting the Elk River so this will have to be given a separate report.
The Upper Clayoquot River was inspected on November 17th. Three thousand sockeye were seen and most of them were spent fish. About the number of chums was not very few of the head commenced spawning and most of them were found schooled together in deep pools.
At the time Pond Creek was filled with sockeye from its mouth and were jumping onto the apron of the overflow.
A goodly number of sockeye spawned at the mouth of Taylor Creek early in the season. The Lake fell a little and left the creek dry when the next freshet came the creek bed was scoured and many of the eggs were washed out into the Lake when about seventy seagulls were feeding.
There were not many spring salmon spawning at the head of the Rapids this year and less than the usual number of chums. I estimate there would be about two hundred springs and between four and five hundred chums. There are still a few pairs of sockeye spawning but the season is just about over.
I figure the cost of collecting this years eggs was $372.45 or 3.625 cents per thousand.
I am, Sir,
Yours obediently,
