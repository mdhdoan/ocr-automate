Muriel Smolt Report, 1987.

Coho sizes and age composition must be tabulated (if samples are still not processed, see to their assembly).

Status of data base re: multiyear records of fence counts by species should be checked.

Peamount club size and age info. needs to be assembled.

Data from 1986 and 1987 should be assembled into a single summary report on Muriel smolt production spanning years 1986-1987 (i.e. 2 years). This report will be required as a precursor to marine survival comparisons.Seasonal Migration Migration Patterns:

Sockeye:

The fence was operational March 18 and the first smolts were caught March 28 (Fig. 2a, Table 1). The dates when the smolt migration was 10, 50 and 90% complete were April 21, May 1, and May 9 respectively (Table 1). The peak daily passage during the interval March 18 to June 5 was 275 sockeye smolts on April 22 (Fig. 2a).

Coho:

Coho smolts emigrated primarily between late April and early June (Fig. 2b). The dates when the smolt migration was April 29, May 4, and May 24 respectively (Table 1). The largest daily catch occurred on May 2 (99 smolts) (Fig. 2b, Table 1).

In general, coho smolts migrated later than sockeye smolts during the 1987 season (Fig. 2a & b).

Environmental Observations:

During the interval of juvenile sockeye migration in 1987, water temperatures ranged from a low of 8.5 degrees Celsius (March 20) to a high of 18.5 degrees Celsius (May 25) (Appendix 2).

Measurable precipitation, recorded at the Tofino Airport, occurred on 45 of the 78 days that observations were made (Appendix 2).

During the peak period of smolt migration (April 24 to May 7), water levels fluctuated from a low of 0.64 meters on April 29 to a high of 0.94 meters on May 4 (Appendix 2).

Biological Characteristics:

A total of 22 samples containing between 2 and 142 smolts per sample were obtained from the smolt trap and or fence and trap mortalities during the interval March 28 to May 19 (Table 2). Although a total of 407 sockeye smolts (16.8% of the estimated total number of migrants) were collected, only 396 were used to determine the mean lengths and weights of the migrants and a portion of these were used to determine the age composition of the run.

Sockeye smolts sampled at the Muriel Creek fence site during the 1987 season and processed in the laboratory were represented by two age-classes (1.0 and 2.0) (Table 2). Two-year-old fish (2.0) were the dominant age class, representing 64.6% of the total total catch (Table 2).Size Composition:

The mean fork lengths of one-year-old smolts ranged from 73 mm to 103 mm and two-year-old smolts ranged in size from 86 to 118 mm (Table 2a).

The 1967 sampling indicated that the average lengths of sockeye smolts leaving the system varied according to no fixed pattern. Whereas both 1.0 and 2.0 decreased in mean weight over the course of the monitoring period (Table 2b).

Sockeye smolts migrating from Muriel Lake were monitored from March 18 to June 5. The first smolts were trapped at the counting fence March 28. The times when 50 and 90% of the sockeye smolts left the system were May 1 and May 9 respectively. In 1987 sockeye smolts were numerically the most common fish leaving the lake. A total of 2416 sockeye smolts migrated from Muriel Lake. Other species caught at the fence site include: coho fry and smolts, peamouth chub, sculpins, cutthroat trout, stickleback and lamprey. Two age types (1.0 and 2.0) contributed to the run. 2.0 predominated in 1987, comprising 64.6% of the total catch.INTRODUCTION

Between the years 1969 and 1975, investigators with the Fisheries Research Board of Canada conducted an experimental study at Great Central Lake, British Columbia to test the hypothesis that increasing the supply of inorganic nutrients in an ultraoligotrophic lake would increase production at succeeding trophic levels and would consequently serve as a useful technique to enhance the productivity of a stock of sockeye salmon. LeBrassuer et al. (1978) reported that during fertilized years mean summer primary production increased fivefold, zooplankton standing stock increased 9 times, the percentage survival from estimated potential egg deposition to juvenile sockeye increased 2.6 times, while mean stock size of adult sockeye increased from <50,000 to >360,000. Given the apparent 7-fold increase in Great Central Lake adult sockeye returns compared to pretreatment "historic" levels LeBrassuer et al. (1979) concluded that lake fertilization could serve as a highly cost-effective technique to enhance sockeye salmon. Thus, when the Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) was launched in 1977 as a joint effort of the Federal and Province of British Columbia Governments, an expanded Lake Enrichment Program (LEP) was initiated as an experimental technique for the enhancement of sockeye salmon in a variety of B.C. coastal lakes. The Fisheries Research Branch (FRB) serves as the source of scientific and technical expertise with funding provided by SEP.

The primary objective of our program is to utilize lake fertilization wherever possible as a cost-effective technique to maximize the production of sockeye salmon on the B.C. coast. Consequently, we conduct research in support of this long-term goal to determine when, where, how often and by what biological mechanisms lake enrichment works as a technique to enhance the production of natural stocks of sockeye salmon (Stockner and Hyatt 1984).

The fish ecology unit of LEP has been grappling with three general assessment issues since 1977. These are:

1. Does lake fertilization generally influence the size attained by juvenile sockeye such that smolts routinely leave at a larger size from treated as opposed to untreated coastal lakes?

2. Will larger sockeye smolts experience higher marine survivals or exhibit changes in age-at-return such that the harvestable biomass of adult sockeye available to the fishery is increased enough to more than compensate for the costs of lake treatment?

3. Does lake fertilization influence the within-lake survival of juvenile sockeye such that more smolts are produced per spawner in treated years as opposed to untreated years?

Studies are underway in a variety of coastal lakes toresolve these issues and substantial progress has been made. For example, Hyatt and Stockner (1985) have reported on the demonstration of a clear link between enhanced production at lower trophic levels and the increased size of sockeye smolts migrating from treated B.C. coastal lakes. These authors also marshal arguments in support of predictions by SEP that such changes should result in significant gains in adult sockeye returns.

Studies to contribute to the resolution of the questions listed above have been underway at Hobiton Lake since early in 1977, the lake's first year of treatment (Stephens and Stockner 1983; Manzer et al. 1984; Hyatt et al. 1985). However, by 1980 it was recognized that various assessment procedures previously adopted would require increased effort and further standardization at a limited number of lakes to generate data of relatively constant precision and known accuracy on brood-year variations in smolt size, smolt abundance and adult returns. It was clear that failure to do this would prevent us from reliably assessing the impact of treatment-induced growth or size variations on within-lake survival rates, marine survival rates, age-at-return or yield of adult sockeye for any B.C. outer coast sockeye stock. Consequently, Muriel Lake was selected (along with Great Central, Sproat, Henderson, Long, Cheewhat and Hobiton) as a key study lake. Accordingly, at Muriel Lake we now complete multiple estimates throughout the year of juvenile sockeye growth, population size and body size at seaward migration. The entire smolt population has been counted out through fences at the lake outlet since 1983 and a partial count was made at a fence in 1979 by FSB personnel. Returning adults have been enumerated and sampled during foot surveys, 1982-1985, and at a counting fence in 1986 and 1987. The present report is written for the purpose of providing interim analyses and interpretations of the Muriel studies as they proceed to completion. This report deals with information on sockeye smolt population population size, migration patterns and biological characteristics as assessed at the counting fence during 1987. The primary goals of operating the counting fence were to obtain high accuracy and utility of (1) juvenile sockeye population estimates derived from application of hydroacoustic and midwater trawl techniques and (2) unweighted estimates of sockeye smolt age and size composition in a wide range of British Columbia coastal lakes.

STUDY AREA

Muriel Lake is located on the west coast of Vancouver Island. It has a surface area of 145 ha with a mean depth ofm. (Nidle et al., 1984, Rutherford et al., 1986). Muriel Creek originates at Muriel Lake and flows in a southwesterly direction for approximately 2.4 km where it joins the Kennedy River (Fig. 1). This system is used extensively by spawning coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon. Muriel Creek is a low gradient stream congested with logging debris throughout. The substrate varies from sand-gravel to sand. Water flow is generally less than 5 cfs, except following heavy, prolonged rainfalls (Thorson, 1979).

There are four tributary streams entering Muriel Lake, two of which support spawning sockeye. The four tributaries are labeled S1, S2, S3, and S4 and the beach spawning areas are B1, B2, and B3 (Fig. 2). During the period 1917 to 1936 Kennedy Lake hatchery personnel referred to tributaries S2 and S3 as David and Donald creeks.

S1 is low gradient, contains several overhanging banks, and ranges in width from 4.2 m to 11.6 m. Fallen logs and trees crisscross the entire length of the stream. The lower 400 m is utilized by spawning sockeye and coho salmon. The substrate is comprised of boulders, gravel and fines with very little silt.

S2 (Donald Creek), located on the north end of Muriel Lake, is a high gradient stream which divides into two sections 100 m above the lake. This stream has a mean width of 1.5 m and is comprised of boulders with very little gravel. Spawning occurs in the vicinity of the stream mouth only.

S3 (David Creek), is also located on the north end of the lake. The lower 50 m of the stream supports spawning sockeye and coho. The average width of this stream is 1.5 m and has a cobble-boulder substrate. The upper portions of this stream are of too great a gradient to support spawning coho and sockeye salmon.

S4 flows into the southeast end of the lake. This stream is of very low gradient with a sand-mud bottom and varies in width from 1.5 to 2.0 m. No spawning has been observed in this tributary.

Beach spawning has been observed in the area surrounding the mouth of S1 and in the areas designated as B2 and B3 (Fig. 2). The majority of beach spawning has been observed in the area between S2 and S3 (Fig. 2). These areas are comprised of compact gravel with a considerable amount of fines. All areas are littered with logging debris. The amount of suitable habitat available to spawning sockeye is very limited in the areas designated as B1 and B2.

The Muriel Lake watershed is influenced by high annual rainfall (exceeding 300 cm), which causes extreme variability in both water level and flow (Rutherford et al., 1986).

METHODS

Study Site DescriptionIn 1979 a fence site was established underneath the west main line logging road bridge (Fig.1) by the Thornton Creek Enhancement Society as part of a coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) reconnaissance program made available by the Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans, Nanaimo, B.C.). Between 1983 and 1987 an alternate site was established below the Muriel Lake road bridge (Fig.1). The present study site is 12.2 m wide and the river bottom consists of gravel (<5.0 cm) and sand. Water flows at this site are generally less than 5 cfs except following heavy, prolonged rainfall. Water levels at this site are also affected by water backed up from Ilthpaya Lake.

Description of the Fence:

Muriel Creek Fence:

The Muriel Creek fence was used to enumerate both juvenile and adult sockeye during the interval, March 18 to June 5 and September 26 to December 4 respectively. During the period June 5 to September 26 the fence site remained closed to ensure that no adult sockeye would be able to migrate through the fence unaccounted for. On December 4 the screens were removed from the superstructure and monitoring of the site ceased for the 1987 season.

The superstructure, excluding the widths of the two bulkheads, was 11.8 m wide and 1.2 m high. In design the fence consisted of 9 A-frames (made of 10.0 cm x 5.0 cm x 0.47 cm channel aluminum), which were bolted to the platform floor. The A-frames were held rigid in an upright position by two 3.1 m stringers (made of 10.0 cm x 5.0 cm x 0.47 cm channel aluminum) bolted to the front or upstream member and extending the length of the fence. A-frames were set 1.5 m apart. A total of 13, 1.8 m x 0.93 m channel aluminum frames (made of 5.0 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.3 cm channel aluminum) were installed along the face of the fence. Each frame housed a 1.8 m x 0.92 m screen (made of 3.8 cm x 3.8 cm x 0.45 cm angle aluminum) with 0.79 cm expanded steel mesh. The channels facilitated removal of the screens when removal of organic debris was required. The screens were inclined downstream at an angle of 45 degrees from the perpendicular.

A-frames were designed so that once the fence was in position a catwalk could be added to the top of the fence.

The area between the bottom of the screens and the platform floor was sealed with sand bags.

The Muriel Creek fence was installed March 18 and trapping of smolts continued through to June 5.

Trap Design:

During the interval March 18 to April 21 the smolt trapping offacilities comprised 3 escape portals (10.2 cm x 30.5 cm heating vents) set into a screen on the north side of the fence. Three lengths (8m) of big-o pipe were attached to the portals which ended in a 1.2 x 2.4 meter live box fitted with styrofoam floatation. The live box was cabled to the fence so as to reduce the possibility that the pipes could pull away from the live box. This trapping facility was found to be unsuitable as it caused considerable fence mortalities. Smolts experienced difficulty finding the escape escape portals, as a result the smolts were eventually sucked onto the escape fence portals screens.

A new method of trapping migrating salmonids had to be developed at the Muriel Creek Creek fence that would reduce fence induced mortalities. One of the first considerations was to incorporate large escape portals in the main fence so as to reduce the amount of time smolts would spend searching the main fence for the exits to the live box and (2) Water flowing through these portals would have to be high enough so as to attract the migrants into these areas.

A new trapping facility was put on line April 21-23. The trapping facility was essentially three cubicles attached to the downstream side of the main fence and connected to a floating live box by a series (9) of flexible hoses. Migrating smolts would pass across the face of the fence and drop through one of three .9m x 1.8m openings into a fish tight box approximately 0.9m wide x 1.2m high x 1.8m long. The downstream end of the boxes had three openings to which big-o pipe was attached. A total of 9 pipes transported fish to the live box.

Fence and Trap Operation:

In general smolts were removed from the trap, twice daily. Smolts were removed from the trap with a dipnet, counted and released. Hand tallies were used to enumerate the smolts processed and the totals for each observation period were recorded for analysis at a later date.

In general smolts were enumerated in the morning (0900-1100) and late afternoon (1600-1800).

Biological Sampling:

Sockeye samples were obtained intermittently throughout the course of monitoring period (March 18 to June 5). Samples were comprised of fence induced mortalities and samples removed from the smolt trap. Sample sizes ranged from 2 to 142 sockeye. Samples made up of fence mortalities and trap samples were collected on 9 days, trap samples on 9 days and samples only made up were collected on 4 days. A total of 407 fish were collected for the 1967 season.

Trap samples were removed from the trap with a dipnet and transferred to a bucket containing a strong solution (100 to 1 of concentrate) of 2-phenoxyethanol. After killing, the smolts were transferred to 1 litre jars. Each jar was half filled with smolts and topped with a 10% formaline solution (1 litre of 34%formaldehyde and 4 teaspoons of borax diluted with water to 10 litres). Each jar was labelled according to the guidelines provided by Hyatt et al (1984). Fence mortalities were jared and preserved is the same manner as for trap samples.

Laboratory Analysis of Samples:

Smolts collected during the 1987 season were stored in 10% formalin for a period of 5 weeks before weighing and measuring individual fish. This allowed lengths and weights of preserved samples to stabilize. This period of time preserved smolts undergo significant weight gain (Parker, 1963) and therefore are not directly comparable with smolts weighed fresh. Weights of preserved specimens were converted to that of fresh weights by a weight reduction factor determined by weighing individual fish before and after preservation (Hyatt, unpublished data). Smolt lengths were found not to decrease significantly enough to warrant conversion to a standardized fresh length and therefore no correction conversion factor is applied (Hyatt, unpublished data, pers.comm., T. Cone, Maclaren Plansearch, Vancouver, B.C.).

All smolts were weighed individually by using a digital balance (Metzler P300). Weights were recorded to the nearest 0.01 gram from blot dried specimens. Moisture was blotted from the exterior of each fish, and gentle pressure was applied to the buccal cavity to remove moisture from this space.

The length of each fish was measured to the nearest millimeter, from the nose to the end of the central rays of the caudal fin. This measurement is referred to as fork length.

Scales were taken from a subsample of each sample group. The scales were removed from the preferred area (Bilton, 1984) and mounted in scale books.

Environmental Observations:

Water levels and water temperatures were recorded between 0800-1100 hr each day (April 13 to June 5), prior to this date readings were collected sporadically throughout the period March 18 to April 20. Water levels were obtained from a gauge (graduated in cm.) situated approximately 3.0 meters upstream of the Muriel Creek fence. Water temperatures were obtained at the fence sites by reading a pocket thermometer immersed by hand. Weather at the study site was observed but recorded in general terms too imprecise to permit quantitative assessment of the impact on the number of downstream migrants. Daily precipitation was obtained from the Totino Airport, approximately 30 km west of Muriel Lake.**Results and Discussion**

**Fish Abundance and Species Composition:**

The total number of fish intercepted at the Muriel Creek fence in 1987 is a combination of sockeye smolts (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho fry and smolts (Oncorhynchus kisutch), peamouth chub (Mylocheilus caurinus), cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki clarki), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), sculpins (Cottus asper), and lamprey (Lampetra sp.). A total of 7524 fish were caught in 1987 of which sockeye smolts (32.11%), peamouth chub (29.89%), sculpins (28.06%) were the dominant species. Coho smolts, coho, coho fry, cutthroat trout, stickleback and lamprey comprised 6.1, 2.8, 0.04 and 0.06% of the total trap catches respectively.

**Sockeye Smolts:**

Sockeye smolt abundance is a combination of live smolts trapped and released, fence and trap mortalities and sample mortalities. During the 1987 season sockeye smolts were enumerated from March 18 to June 5. A total of 2416 sockeye smolts were enumerated, mortalities accounted for 23.59% (570) of the total catch (Table 1).

The estimate of total smolt abundance (2416) must be considered conservative for the following reasons: (1) Some sockeye undoubtedly migrated to sea both before and after the interval of fence operation. This number is unlikely to be large as only small portions of the total number of migrants that were enumerated left during the first four weeks of fence operation (Table 1). (2) During the first week in the interval March 18 to April 15 the fence was monitored sporadically with checks being made on 12 of 29 days. Estimates of abundance must be considered conservative for this period as the integrity of the fence was questionable during this time. On April 16 the onsite observer found the seal between the base of the screen and the floor to be breached in several places, which would have allowed smolts to migrate unaccounted for. (3) The fence was also incurring heavy mortalities during this same period, and the estimates of fence mortalities must also be considered conservative because a large proportion of these would have been removed by predators or scavengers, especially during the intervals when the fence wasn't being checked. (4) Due to high water levels it was difficult to find all the leaks in the fence site and therefore the 1967 estimate or sockeye smolt abundance must be considered conservative. After April 16 every attempt was made to seal all the possible leaks in the fence but as we found during the summer when we resealed the entire fence there were still several problem areas that had not been found during the spring program.

**Other Species:**

A total of 2249 peamouth chub, 458 coho smolts, 214 coho fry, 2111 sculpins, 67 cutthroat trout, 3 stickleback, and 6 lamprey were also captured during the 1987 program (Table 1 and Appendix 1).
