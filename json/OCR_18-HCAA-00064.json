Contingency measures are required if these measures fail to meet criteria.",
    "Condition_summary_2": "Monitoring and reporting are mandatory, including post-construction assessments, fish sampling, and vegetation survival checks. Reports must be submitted by June 14, 2022.",
    "Condition_summary_3": "Prohibition on depositing deleterious substances in water frequented by fish. Compliance with other regulatory agencies is required.",
    "Condition_summary_4": "The Proponent is solely responsible for design and safety of works. Authorization cannot be transferred without prior notification to DFO.",
    "Habitat_Type": "marsh habitat, unnamed tributary restoration, riparian buffer, storm water management pond, realigned drain channels",
    "Fish_species": "None explicitly listed in section 4; general references to fish utilization and species composition in monitoring sections",
    "Offset_footprint_size": "marsh habitat expansion (size unspecified), unnamed tributary restoration (size unspecified), riparian buffer planting (80% coverage target), Hooper Drain channel (morphology retention), Central Drain channel (morphology retention), SWM pond (average depth 0.9m)",
    "Vegetation_Cover": "80% survival for aquatic vegetation in marsh and 80% coverage for riparian plantings",
