- The isolation of the existing channel and pond sections to be infilled and realigned using sandbag/impervious membrane dams at either end and the rescuing and relocating of fish trapped within the isolated sections.

**Description of Authorized work(s), undertaking(s) or activity(ies) likely to result in the harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction of fish habitat:**

The work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies) associated with the proposed project described above, that are likely to result in the harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction of fish habitat, are:

- Realignment and decommissioning of the lower 375 m of Hooper Drain to the east, around the enlarged SWM pond.

CanadaPATH No.: 18-HCAA-00064

The authorized work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies) are likely to result in the following impacts to fish and fish habitat:
