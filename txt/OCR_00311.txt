2.1.4 Work that could result in sedimentation shall stop during periods of heavy or persistent rainfall.

2.2 List of measures and standards to avoid and mitigate impacts to fish and fish habitat:

2.2.1 To protect spawning fish, their incubating eggs and larval life stages, no in-water works shall occur during the restricted activity timing window of March 15 to June 15 of any given year. 2.2.2 All in-water activities shall be undertaken in isolation (i.e., cofferdam) of open or flowing water to maintain the natural flow of water downstream and avoid introducing sediment into the watercourse.

2.2.3 Temporary cofferdams shall consist of non-permeable material and only materials free of silt and other fine particles shall be used; earthen cofferdams shall not be used for this purpose.

2.2.4 Prior to any in-water works and/or dewatering activities, a fish rescue shall be completed within all isolated areas.

2.2.5 A qualified fisheries professional shall be on site at the onset of in-water work activities and for the duration of the fish rescue and relocation activities. The qualified fisheries professional shall keep a record of the days and times they are onsite. They shall have the authority to provide direction to the contractor during the in-water works and shall temporarily stop work if the potential for serious harm to fish goes beyond the allowable serious harm to fish that is authorized herein.

2.2.6 Fish rescues shall be conducted by a qualified fisheries professional using appropriate and effective capture and handling procedures designed to minimize mortality (e.g., electrofishing, seine netting, minnow trapping), and with a level of effort to effectively mitigate the death of fish by stranding. All fish shall be released unharmed to the watercourse outside of the isolation.

2.2.7 Where water is pumped from the waterbody for any purpose, pump intakes shall be screened in accordance with DFO's Freshwater Intake End-of-Pipe Fish Screen Guideline, 1995. The outlet shall have a diffuser to dissipate energy or be placed in a location that is not subject to erosion from the outflow.

2.2.8 Clearing of riparian vegetation shall be minimized and vegetation shall be replanted where required upon project completion in accordance with tender drawings McClung Community Residential Subdivision - Seneca Creek Modifications and Enhancements prepared by WSP Canada Group Limited, dated September 2018.
