The above described work, undertaking or activity must be carried on in accordance with the following conditions:

1. Conditions that relate to the period during which the work, undertaking or activity can be carried on:

The work, undertaking or activity is/are authorized to be carried on during the following period:

From June 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021.

If the Proponent cannot complete the work, undertaking or activity during this period, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) must be notified in advance of the expiration of the above time period.

The periods during which other conditions of this authorization must be complied with are provided in their respective sections below.2. Conditions that relate to measures and standards to avoid and mitigate impacts to fish and fish habitat, including impacts to aquatic species at risk and their critical habitat as well as the introduction of non-indigenous species:

2.1 Sediment and erosion control; Sediment and erosion control measures must be in place and shall be upgraded and maintained, such that release of sediment is avoided at the location of the authorized work, undertaking, or activity.
2.1.1 Effective erosion and sediment control measures shall be in place prior to, during, and after construction, and until revegetation or other mitigation measures are sufficient to control erosion, and shall be maintained, repaired, and/or upgraded as required to function properly and prevent sediment from entering fish habitat.
2.1.2 All spoil materials and debris shall be disposed of above the high water mark (HWM) such that it does not enter the watercourse. Any materials stored above the HWM shall be stabilized until properly disposed of.
2.1.3 Work that could result in sedimentation shall stop during periods of heavy or persistent rainfall.

2.2 List of measures and standards to avoid and mitigate impacts to fish and fish habitat including impacts to aquatic species at risk and their critical habitat, as well as the introduction of non-indigenous species:
2.2.1 Work shall be conducted during low flow periods to minimize the duration of in-stream work. If in-water work is required, the work area shall be effectively isolated and maintained from flow using an appropriate method of isolation and properly inspected and maintained throughout construction. Isolation methods shall be constructed of non-erodible material and designed for effective functioning in lotic conditions.
2.2.2 Where water is pumped from fish-frequented waters for any purpose, pump intakes shall be screened in accordance with DFO's Freshwater Intake End-of-Pipe Fish Screen Guideline (1995). The outlet shall have a diffuser or be placed in a location that is not subject to erosion from the outflow.
2.2.3 Pumping systems shall be sized appropriately to accommodate water quantities during construction, and shall be monitored at all times to ensure proper functioning.
2.2.4 Should the need for dewatering arise, water shall be released into a well-vegetated area and not directly into fish-frequented waters. Water returning to fish-frequented waters shall be of equal or better quality than the water in the fish-frequented waters.
2.2.5 Fish in isolated areas shall be rescued and released to an area containing sufficient flow and cover prior to any works commencing within the isolated area. Fish rescues shall be conducted by a biologist qualified to identify and relocate species at risk using appropriate and effective capture and handling procedures designed to minimize mortality (e.g., electrofishing, seine netting, minnow trapping). A provincial fish rescue permit shall be obtained prior to fish rescue operations.
2.2.6 Fish relocation activities shall occur during the valid authorization period. DFO shall be notified in advance of when these activities are initiated, and if there is a need to amend the valid authorization period.
2.2.7 All captures of Channel Darter shall be recorded and digitally vouchered and the species released unharmed to the watercourse downstream of the isolation site. Photo vouchers shall be taken while SAR are fully submerged in a net or viewing box.
2.2.7.1 SAR shall be sorted from the non-SAR and processed before all other species.
2.2.7.2 During processing, fishes shall be kept in multiple buckets/tubs shall be replaced every 10 minutes or otherwise aerated (flow-through, aeration stones, etc.) to maintain dissolved oxygen levels and water temperatures (within ±1°C).
2.2.7.3 Buckets/tubs shall be covered to reduce stress and placed in full shade.2.2.8 To the extent possible, works shall be conducted in a manner whereby any individuals of the species shall be handled only in the circumstances authorized and with the least amount of harm.

2.2.9 Every effort shall be made to minimize disruption of important habitat features, including rocks and coarse woody debris. In the event that rocks or coarse woody debris are overprinted or impacted by works, these features shall be moved to a similar location within the watercourse away from the worksite.

2.2.10 Water quality sampling shall be conducted during works in or near water, and shall include a minimum of one control site upstream of the zone of influence of the works.

2.2.11 Scour protection measures shall be implemented in high velocity areas including the guide bank and embankment.

2.2.12 All riprap shall:

2.2.12.1 Be clean and free of fine materials and debris prior to placement and of sufficient size to resist displacement during design flood events;

2.2.12.2 Not be obtained from areas below the ordinary high water mark of any fish-frequented waters;

2.2.12.3 Shall be placed in a non-uniform manner to provide additional aquatic habitat diversity.

2.2.13 Disturbed areas associated with the construction site shall be revegetated as soon as possible with native vegetation.

2.2.14 Equipment shall arrive on site in a clean condition and be maintained free of fluid leaks, invasive species and noxious weeds.

2.2.15 Equipment operating in or near fish-frequented waters shall be operated, refuelled and serviced in a manner that prevents spills, leaks or wash water from entering fish-frequented waters.

2.3 Contingency measures: Contingency measures, as described in "Attachment 8 – Description of Measures and Standards to Avoid or Mitigate Serious Harm to Fish and Aquatic SAR", shall be put in place if monitoring required in section 3 below indicates that the measures and standards to avoid and mitigate impacts to fish and fish habitat including impacts to aquatic species at risk and their critical habitat, as well as the introduction of non-indigenous species, are not successful. DFO shall be notified immediately in the event that contingency measures are required.

2.4 Dates by which these measures and standards shall be implemented: Measures and standards to avoid and mitigate impacts to fish and fish habitat including impacts to aquatic species at risk and their critical habitat, as well as the introduction of non-indigenous species, shall be implemented before, during, and following in-water works.
