**Section 1. Conditions that relate to the period during which the work(s), undertaking(s) or activity(ies) will result in serious harm to fish**

The work(s), undertaking(s), or activities(ies) that can result in serious harm to fish are authorized to be carried on during this period:

- **From:** Date of Issuance
  - To: December 31, 2020

**Details:**
If the Proponent cannot complete the work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies) during this period, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) must be notified in advance of the expiration of the above time period. DFO may, where appropriate, provide written notice that the period to carry on the work(s), undertakings(s), or activity(ies); has been extended.

The periods during which any other conditions apply, this authorization must be complied with by being provided in their respective sections below. DFO may, where appropriate, provide written notice that these periods have been extended, in order to correspond to the extension of the period to carry on work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies).

---

**Section 2. Conditions that relate to measures and standards to avoid and mitigate serious harm to fish**

- **Sediment and erosion control:**
  - Sediment and erosion control measures must be in place and shall be upgraded and maintained, such that release of sediment is avoided at the location of the authorized work(s), undertaking(s), or activity(ies).

    a. An Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) plan shall be developed for the site that avoids sediment from entering the NSR during all phases of the project.

    b. Effective sediment control measures must include:
      - Installed prior to construction and inspected, maintained as required;
      - During in-water activities, an on-site environmental monitor will provide mitigation measures are in place and functioning; and
      - Implementation of a TSS/urbidity program to monitor downstream sediment release from unexpected sources;

    c. Minimize clearing of riparian vegetation.

- **List of measures and standards:**
  - Described below as set out in the Proponent’s plan (Serafina Application for Authorization and Offsetting Plan), and any subsequent version(s), approved by DFO after referred to as “The Plan”.

    a. Sheet piles, serving as isolation structures before the OHWM shall be installed outside of the spring Restricted Activity Period.

    b. Fish will be removed from the isolated work area by fisheries professionals using standard methodology and multi-pass elimination from dewatered construction areas; prior to dewatering the area entirely. Fish shall be enumerated to species and number them, then relocated immediately into the river outside of the construction area. The qualified fisheries professional should have the authority to provide direction during the dewatering.

### Relocation Activities and Temporary Work Authorization for Serious Harm to Fish Beyond Site Authority:

Relocation activities temporarily stop work if there is potential for serious harm to fish beyond what is authorized here. This authority shall also be extended to all DFO staff present at the project site.

#### 2.2.1. During Isolation on Dewatering Pumps Used Shall Be Screened according to DFA Freshwater Intake and End-of-Pipe Fish Screen Guideline (1995).

- Flow in the NSR shall be maintained throughout construction and fish passage shall be maintained past the construction site at all times.

#### 2.2.4. A Spill Management Plan

- Machinery and equipment shall be maintained in clean condition free of leaks.
- An on-site environmental monitor shall be on-hand during sensitive work to inspect for leaks and administer the Spill Management Plan when necessary.

#### 2.2.6. Fueling Equipment and Maintenance Shall Take Place Away from the Watercourse; Fish screens for “intake operation” previously described as DFO:

- Fish screen areas must meet requirements of .125 m^3/ s intake flow (7,045 m^3 of total surface area), when 3.589 m^2 is a minimum to prevent entrainment and impingement measures.

#### 2.2.7. Water Diverted for this Project Should Follow the DFA Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat’s (CSAS) criteria outlined in, “For Assessing the Ecological Flow Requirements to Support Fisheries in Canada” for the NSR:

- "Water diverted from water use exceeding intake flow" should follow conditions within the Water Security Agency Permit.

#### 2.3.1. Contingency Measures

- Cease all work immediately if sediment-laden water or other deleterious substances are entering the watercourse.
- Turbidity levels and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) concentrations shall not exceed guidelines provided by Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
- Should daily monitoring or ESC measures show that they are not functioning as intended, all work shall be halted and the issue corrected prior to work resuming.

#### 2.3.4. Contingency Measures

- Cease re-suspended sediment should be observed entering the waterbody outside of the work site; work shall cease and additional ESC measures shall be installed to isolate the work area prior to work resuming.**Title:**
PATH #: 18-HCAA-00192

---

**Section Heading:** 
3.5. Should a breach in the site be isolated during de-watering, work shall cease; the site re-isolated and fish shall be removed from the isolated work area prior to de-watering and resuming the work.

Once all fish have been removed, work may recommence within the isolated work area.
