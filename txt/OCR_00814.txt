4.1 Letter of credit: Not Applicable (N/A)

4.2 Scale and description of offsetting measures: In accordance with the Proponent's offsetting plan found in the Application for Authorization (February 27, 2015), the following measures shall be undertaken:

4.2.1 Construction of 3200 m² of boulder/cobble habitat and installation of a minimum of 75 large boulders (minimum diameter 1.5 m in all directions) on 5 m spacing downstream of instream piers to provide enhanced spawning habitat and cover for Lake Sturgeon and other fish species.

4.2.2 Operating the Timiskaming Ontario Water Control Dam to enhance spawning opportunities for Lake Sturgeon, Lake Whitefish, and other fish species.

a) An Operating Plan for the Timiskaming Ontario Dam shall be developed by the proponent in discussion with DFO to guide the opening and closing of select bays to provide water volumes and velocities that are to the benefit of spawning fish to the extent that natural inflows, water management requirements, and safe operations of the dam allow. The plan shall provide a range of operating options from October 1 to July 15 of any given year to provide as much optimal spawning and egg development habitat as possible for fish species as outlined below. This plan shall be provided to DFO for review and approval by January 31, 2016. The Operating Plan shall be modified as agreed to in writing by DFO for the life of the structure if monitoring finds that certain open/closed bay patterns or flow velocities are more attractive and suitable for successful spawning and egg development, or at the request of DFO and in discussion with the proponent.

b) Lake Whitefish: Operate the dam to create even flows across the river channel and quiet areas next to moderate current to optimize suitable habitat for Lake Whitefish to spawn near the dam. This shall be achieved by alternating open and closed bays across the structure, and maintaining water velocities of 0.5-1 m/s in the open bays immediately adjacent to closed bays. This operation shall continue to the extent that natural inflows and operational requirements allow from October 1 until water levels upstream and downstream of the dam are approximately even in mid-February each year and all stop logs are removed.
